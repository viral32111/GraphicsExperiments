# Graphics Experiments

These are my experiments around creating graphics with [GDI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/gdi/windows-gdi) and [Direct2D](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/direct2d/direct2d-portal) on [Win32 applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/desktop-programming).

This is an C++20 / C17 project, that uses the Windows subsystem, developed in Visual Studio 2022.

## Screenshot

Currently the application draws a yellow-to-green gradient rectangle with a black outline, and a black empty circle in the middle of it.
